If you are a student at the Hertie School who is interested in publishing some of your own work or insights, we'd love to hear from you! Please follow the instructions below to contribute an article to this blog. 

Articles posted on the Data Science Student Projects website are authored using [Distill for R
Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/distill). The steps required to
contribute a new article are as follows:

1.  Create a [GitHub
    repository](http://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html) to host your
    article. We'll use the repository for feedback and review of the post before
    it's published.

2.  Create a new [distill article](https://rstudio.github.io/distill) and check it
    into the GitHub repository (be sure to check in the the Rmd source code and
    the generated HTML files). 

3.  Be sure that you've included all required [article metadata](#). 

4.  [Post an issue](https://github.com/hertie-data-science-lab/student-projects) on the
    Data Science Student Projects GitHub repo requesting that we accept your article (be sure
    to include a link back to your article's GitHub repo!).

Once we see your issue we'll take a look at your article, suggest changes as necessary, then publish it when it's ready.

### Article metadata

To be included in the blog, your article should include some standard metadata
fields. Here's an example of a post that includes all required metadata:
